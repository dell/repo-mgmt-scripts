<h1><i>Unofficial</i> Dell System-Specific Linux yum repository</h1>

<h2>What is this?</h2> 

<p>This repository contains an extract of all of the drivers in Server
Assistant. Because Dell develops, tests, and ships drivers on a per-platform
basis, the Server Assistant CD contains a cross-reference for which drivers
belong to each system. We have extracted these drivers into a series of
system-specific 'yum' repositories.</p>

<p>Becuase this repository is based on the Server Assistant contents, it
contains drivers only for the Dell PowerEdge Server series. Also, because Server
Assistant only supports RHEL 3, RHEL 4, SLES 9, and SLES 10, those are the only
OSes currently supported in this repository. (but see CentOS note below)</p>

<p>Server Assistant background: Dell ships a CD set with each PowerEdge server.
One of the CDs in this set contains Server Assistant. Server Assistant is a CD
that will assist you in re-installing the Operating System on your Dell
PowerEdge server. This CD contains all of the updated drivers and RPMs that are
installed in the Dell factory. For example, driver updates for new storage
controller and such.</p>

<p>The CD containing Server Assistant has been called various things, "Dell
Server Assistant CD" (DSA), the "Dell Installation and Server Management CD"
(ISM), and in the future, it is possible that it will be called the "Common
Deploy and Update CD" (CDU).</p>

<p>We expect that in the future, as we get a better way to get the
drivers for Precision workstations, we will be able to post drivers for
Precision. And, of course, as Dell expands its Linux offerings, we
expect to post other platform specific stuff here as well.</p>

<h2>Supported Hardware</h2>

<p> All systems supported by OM 5.2 Server Assistant are suppored by
this repo. The version of Server Assistant carried on OM 5.2 was used to
create this repo.</p>

<h2>Supported Operating Systems</h2>

<p> OM 5.2 officially supports RHEL 3, RHEL 4, SLES 9, and SLES 10.
These are the OSes supported by this repo. </p>

<p>Note: "rebuilt" versions of the above such as CentOS or ScientificLinux
*should* work. Please report problems to the mailing list and we will
(unofficially) try to make these OSes work if there are problems. </p>

<p>Community distros such as Fedora and OpenSuse are <b>completely untested</b>
with this repo. As such, they may or may not work. Most of the kernel drivers in
this repo are in DKMS format. As such, there is a likelyhood that they may work,
but in general, we do nothing to test or ensure that these packages work with
Fedora. If you have problems, let us know on the mailing list and we will report
them back. There is no guarantee that these will be fixed.</p>

<h2>How to set up</h2>

<h2><a id="yum">How to set up for usage with yum (minimum required version: yum
2.4.x): RHEL5, CentOS, Scientific
Linux, RHEL3+yum, RHEL4+yum, SLES+yum</a></h2>

Note: The version of yum distributed on CentOS 3 by default is too old (yum
2.0.8). You will need to upgrade to a yum 2.4.x version in order to use these
repositories. The older version of yum does not support plugins or mirrorlists,
which are required for these repos to work.

<ol>

<li>Set up the Dell Sofware Repository at 
<a href="http://<!--#echo var="SERVER_NAME" --><!--#exec cmd="echo -en $SCRIPT_NAME | perl -p -e 's|/HEADER.html||; s|hardware$||;'"-->software">http://<!--#echo var="SERVER_NAME" --><!--#exec cmd="echo -en $SCRIPT_NAME | perl -p -e 's|/HEADER.html||; s|hardware$||;'" -->software</a>,
like this: 

<div class="fragment"><pre>
wget -q -O - http://<!--#echo var="SERVER_NAME" --><!--#exec cmd="echo -en $SCRIPT_NAME | perl -p -e 's|/HEADER.html||; s|hardware$||;'" -->software/bootstrap.cgi | bash
</pre></div>

</li>

<li>Install the "dellhw-repository" package, like this: <div
class="fragment"><pre>yum -y install dellhw-repository </pre></div> </li>

<li><b>Optional</b> Install OpenManage Server Administrator:
<div class="fragment"><pre>yum install srvadmin-all</pre></div>
<b>NOTE:</b> OMSA will not install on unsupported systems. If you receive a
message at install that the system is not supported, it is likely that your
system is not supported, and the install will fail. This is most common on
SC-class systems, as OMSA is completely unsupported on these systems.
</li>

</ol>

<h2><a id="up2date">How to set up for usage with up2date: RHEL3, RHEL4</a></h2>

<p>Follow these instructions for use with up2date:</p>

<ol>

<li>Set up the Dell Software Repository at 
<a href="http://<!--#echo var="SERVER_NAME" --><!--#exec cmd="echo -en $SCRIPT_NAME | perl -p -e 's|/HEADER.html||; s|hardware$||;'"-->software">http://<!--#echo var="SERVER_NAME" --><!--#exec cmd="echo -en $SCRIPT_NAME | perl -p -e 's|/HEADER.html||; s|hardware$||;'" -->software</a>,
like this: 

<div class="fragment"><pre>
wget -q -O - http://<!--#echo var="SERVER_NAME" --><!--#exec cmd="echo -en $SCRIPT_NAME | perl -p -e 's|/HEADER.html||; s|hardware$||;'" -->software/bootstrap.cgi | bash
</pre></div>

</li>

<li>Install the "dellhw-repository" package, like this:
<div class="fragment"><pre>
up2date -i dellhw-repository
</pre></div>
</li>

<li><b>Optional</b> Install <a href="#omsa">OpenManage Server Administrator</a>:
<div class="fragment"><pre>
up2date -i srvadmin-all
</pre></div>
<b>NOTE:</b> OMSA will not install on unsupported systems. If you receive a
message at install that the system is not supported, it is likely that your
system is not supported, and the install will fail. This is most common on
SC-class systems, as OMSA is completely unsupported on these systems.
</li>

</ol>

<h2><a id="rug">How to set up for usage with rug: SLES 10</a></h2>

<p>I havent written these instructions yet. Patches welcome!</p>
<p>This repo *should* work with rug, as rug supports yum repo setup. Just have
to get a SLES system to test with.</p>


<h2><a id="manual">Manually configuring the hardware repo</a></h2>

<p>We recommend you use the automatic methods, listed above, but if
for some reason you cannot, use this method instead.</p>

<p> This method is somewhat easy, but limited. Simply look for a directory named after your
system in the list below. Got into that directory and download the dellhw-*.repo
file corresponding to your OS/ARCH and drop it into /etc/yum.repos.d/.</p>

<p>The limitation of this method is that the repo file you install is specific
to the exact system you download. It is not recommended to install
system-specific repository file on a different, non-matching system.</p>

<h2><a id="omsa">OpenManage Server Administrator</a></h2>
This repository contains RPMS for Dell OpenManage Server Administrator (OMSA). 
Currently, OMSA is supported only on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 & 5 and SUSE Linux Enterprise 9 & 10. 
The best way to install OMSA is to install the srvadmin-all metapackage, which
installs all OMSA components.
<p>
Documentation for OMSA 5.2 is here:
<p><a href="http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/software/svradmin/5.2/en/index.htm">OMSA Documentation Index</a>

<p><a href="http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/software/svradmin/5.2/en/ug/html/using.htm#wp1039152">How to start the OMSA GUI</a>
<p>
To install all OMSA components using using yum (on RHEL 5, CentOS 3/4):
<div class="fragment"><pre>
yum install <b><i>**Meta-Package (select from list below)**</i></b>
</pre></div>
To install all OMSA components using up2date (on RHEL releases 3/4):
<div class="fragment"><pre>
up2date -i <b><i>**Meta-Package (select from list below)**</i></b>
</pre></div>

<p>
The following meta packages are provided:
<ul>
<li><b>srvadmin-all</b>: Install all OMSA components</li>
<li><b>srvadmin-base</b>: Install only base OMSA, no web server</li>
<li><b>srvadmin-diagnostics</b>: Install OMSA diagnostics framework</li>
<li><b>srvadmin-webserver</b>: Install Web Interface</li>
<li><b>srvadmin-storageservices</b>: Install RAID Management</li>
<li><b>srvadmin-rac3</b>: Install components to manage the Dell Remote Access Card 3 </li>
<li><b>srvadmin-rac4</b>: Install components to manage the Dell Remote Access Card 4 </li>
