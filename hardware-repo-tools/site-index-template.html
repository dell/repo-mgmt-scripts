<h1>Dell System-Specific Linux repository, <i>aka: Hardware Repository</i></h1>

<h2>What is this?</h2> 

<p>Please see the detailed description in the Linux Wiki: 
<a href="http://linux.dell.com/wiki/index.php/Repository/hardware">Dell Linux hardware repository</a>

<h2>How to set up</h2>

<p><a href="#yum">yum setup instructions</a> for RHEL5, Fedora5+, CentOS.</p>

<p> <a href="#up2date">up2date setup instructions</a> for RHEL4.</p>

<p><a href="#rug">rug setup instructions</a> for SUSE.</p>

<h2><a id="yum">How to set up for usage with yum (minimum required version: yum
2.4.x): RHEL5, CentOS, Scientific Linux, RHEL4+yum, SLES+yum</a></h2>

Note: The version of yum distributed on CentOS 3 by default is too old (yum
2.0.8). You will need to upgrade to a yum 2.4.x version in order to use these
repositories. The older version of yum does not support plugins or mirrorlists,
which are required for these repos to work.

<ol>

<li>Set up this repository:

<div class="fragment"><pre>
wget -q -O - http://<!--#echo var="SERVER_NAME" --><!--#exec cmd="echo -en $SCRIPT_NAME | perl -p -e 's|/HEADER.html||;'" -->/bootstrap.cgi | bash
</pre></div>

</li>

<li><b>Optional</b> Install OpenManage Server Administrator:
<div class="fragment"><pre>yum install srvadmin-all</pre></div>
<b>NOTE:</b> OMSA will not install on unsupported systems. If you receive a
message at install that the system is not supported, it is likely that your
system is not supported, and the install will fail. This is most common on
SC-class systems, as OMSA is completely unsupported on these systems.
</li>

</ol>

<h2><a id="up2date">How to set up for usage with up2date: RHEL4</a></h2>

<p>Follow these instructions for use with up2date:</p>

<ol>

<li>Set up this repository:

<div class="fragment"><pre>
wget -q -O - http://<!--#echo var="SERVER_NAME" --><!--#exec cmd="echo -en $SCRIPT_NAME | perl -p -e 's|/HEADER.html||;'" -->/bootstrap.cgi | bash
</pre></div>

</li>

<li><b>Optional</b> Install <a href="http://linux.dell.com/wiki/index.php/Repository/hardware#OpenManage_Server_Administrator">OpenManage Server Administrator</a>:
<div class="fragment"><pre>
up2date -i srvadmin-all
</pre></div>
<b>NOTE:</b> OMSA will not install on unsupported systems. If you receive a
message at install that the system is not supported, it is likely that your
system is not supported, and the install will fail. This is most common on
SC-class systems, as OMSA is completely unsupported on these systems.
</li>

</ol>

<h2><a id="rug">How to set up for usage with rug: SLES 10</a></h2>

<ol>

<li>Set up this repository:

<div class="fragment"><pre>
wget -q -O - http://<!--#echo var="SERVER_NAME" --><!--#exec cmd="echo -en $SCRIPT_NAME | perl -p -e 's|/HEADER.html||;'" -->/bootstrap.cgi | bash
</pre></div>

</li>

<li><b>Optional</b> Install <a href="http://linux.dell.com/wiki/index.php/Repository/hardware#OpenManage_Server_Administrator">OpenManage Server Administrator</a>:
<div class="fragment"><pre>
rug install srvadmin-base
rug install srvadmin-webserver
rug install srvadmin-storageservices
</pre></div>
<p><b>NOTE 1:</b> OMSA will not install on unsupported systems. If you receive a
message at install that the system is not supported, it is likely that your
system is not supported, and the install will fail. This is most common on
SC-class systems, as OMSA is completely unsupported on these systems.
<p><b>NOTE 2:</b> If you want to install srvadmin-all, you have to have
'setserial' installed. I dont have the details on this, but it doesnt appear
that setserial is installed by default.
</li>

</ol>
