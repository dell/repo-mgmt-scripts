<h1><i>Unofficial</i> Dell System-Specific Linux yum repository</h1>

<h2>What is this?</h2> 

<p>Please see the detailed description in the Linux Wiki: 
<a href="http://linux.dell.com/wiki/index.php/Repository/hardware">Linux yum hardware repository</a>

<h2>How to set up</h2>

<p><a href="#yum">yum setup instructions</a> for RHEL5, Fedora5+, CentOS.</p>

<p> <a href="#up2date">up2date setup instructions</a> for RHEL3/RHEL4.</p>

<p><a href="#rug">rug setup instructions</a> for SUSE.</p>

<h2><a id="yum">How to set up for usage with yum (minimum required version: yum
2.4.x): RHEL5, CentOS, Scientific
Linux, RHEL3+yum, RHEL4+yum, SLES+yum</a></h2>

Note: The version of yum distributed on CentOS 3 by default is too old (yum
2.0.8). You will need to upgrade to a yum 2.4.x version in order to use these
repositories. The older version of yum does not support plugins or mirrorlists,
which are required for these repos to work.

<ol>

<li>Set up this repository:

<div class="fragment"><pre>
wget -q -O - http://<!--#echo var="SERVER_NAME" --><!--#exec cmd="echo -en $SCRIPT_NAME | perl -p -e 's|/HEADER.html||;'" -->/bootstrap.cgi | bash
</pre></div>

</li>

<li><b>Optional</b> Install OpenManage Server Administrator:
<div class="fragment"><pre>yum install srvadmin-all</pre></div>
<b>NOTE:</b> OMSA will not install on unsupported systems. If you receive a
message at install that the system is not supported, it is likely that your
system is not supported, and the install will fail. This is most common on
SC-class systems, as OMSA is completely unsupported on these systems.
</li>

</ol>

<h2><a id="up2date">How to set up for usage with up2date: RHEL3, RHEL4</a></h2>

<p>Follow these instructions for use with up2date:</p>

<ol>

<li>Set up this repository:

<div class="fragment"><pre>
wget -q -O - http://<!--#echo var="SERVER_NAME" --><!--#exec cmd="echo -en $SCRIPT_NAME | perl -p -e 's|/HEADER.html||;'" -->/bootstrap.cgi | bash
</pre></div>

</li>

<li><b>Optional</b> Install <a href="#omsa">OpenManage Server Administrator</a>:
<div class="fragment"><pre>
up2date -i srvadmin-all
</pre></div>
<b>NOTE:</b> OMSA will not install on unsupported systems. If you receive a
message at install that the system is not supported, it is likely that your
system is not supported, and the install will fail. This is most common on
SC-class systems, as OMSA is completely unsupported on these systems.
</li>

</ol>

<h2><a id="rug">How to set up for usage with rug: SLES 10</a></h2>

<b>NOTE:</b> sles support is experimental and broken right now. I am working on
it.

<ol>

<li>Set up this repository:

<div class="fragment"><pre>
wget -q -O - http://<!--#echo var="SERVER_NAME" --><!--#exec cmd="echo -en $SCRIPT_NAME | perl -p -e 's|/HEADER.html||;'" -->/bootstrap.cgi | bash
</pre></div>

</li>

<li><b>Optional</b> Install <a href="#omsa">OpenManage Server Administrator</a>:

<h2><a id="manual">Manually configuring the hardware repo</a></h2>

<p>We recommend you use the automatic methods, listed above, but if
for some reason you cannot, use this method instead.</p>

<p> This method is somewhat easy, but limited. Simply look for a directory named after your
system in the list below. Got into that directory and download the dellhw-*.repo
file corresponding to your OS/ARCH and drop it into /etc/yum.repos.d/.</p>

<p>The limitation of this method is that the repo file you install is specific
to the exact system you download. It is not recommended to install
system-specific repository file on a different, non-matching system.</p>

<h2><a id="omsa">OpenManage Server Administrator</a></h2>
This repository contains RPMS for Dell OpenManage Server Administrator (OMSA). 
Currently, OMSA is supported only on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 & 5 and SUSE Linux Enterprise 9 & 10. 
The best way to install OMSA is to install the srvadmin-all metapackage, which
installs all OMSA components.
<p>
Documentation for OMSA 5.2 is here:
<p><a href="http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/software/svradmin/5.2/en/index.htm">OMSA Documentation Index</a>
<p><a href="http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/software/svradmin/5.2/en/ug/html/index.htm">OMSA User's Guide</a>
<p><a href="http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/software/svradmin/5.2/en/cli/html/index.htm">OMSA Command Line Interface User's Guide</a>
<p><a href="http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/software/svradmin/5.2/en/ug/html/using.htm#wp1039152">How to start the OMSA GUI</a>
<p>
To install all OMSA components using using yum (on RHEL 5, CentOS 3/4):
<div class="fragment"><pre>
yum install <b><i>**Meta-Package (select from list below)**</i></b>
</pre></div>
To install all OMSA components using up2date (on RHEL releases 3/4):
<div class="fragment"><pre>
up2date -i <b><i>**Meta-Package (select from list below)**</i></b>
</pre></div>

<p>
The following meta packages are provided:
<ul>
<li><b>srvadmin-all</b>: Install all OMSA components</li>
<li><b>srvadmin-base</b>: Install only base OMSA, no web server</li>
<li><b>srvadmin-diagnostics</b>: Install OMSA diagnostics framework</li>
<li><b>srvadmin-webserver</b>: Install Web Interface</li>
<li><b>srvadmin-storageservices</b>: Install RAID Management</li>
<li><b>srvadmin-rac3</b>: Install components to manage the Dell Remote Access Card 3 </li>
<li><b>srvadmin-rac4</b>: Install components to manage the Dell Remote Access Card 4 </li>
<li><b>srvadmin-rac5</b>: Install components to manage the Dell Remote Access Card 5 </li>
